# NFT Social Score
NFT Social Score is an attempt to quantify which communities are most active on social media.

We use [NFT Inspect](https://www.nftinspect.xyz/) to gather the twitter handles for the various Solana NFT communities and use the Twitter API to pull tweets from each user for the past week.

# Calculation
- 5 Points: awarded for each tweet
- 1 Point: awarded for each like you receive on a tweet
